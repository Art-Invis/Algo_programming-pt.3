## 📖 About This Repository  

This repository contains a fully documented, multi-language collection of academic lab assignments for the course **Algorithms and Data Structures**. Each lab showcases algorithmic thinking, data processing, and systems-level logic, implemented across **C**, **C++**, and **Rust** — with clear formatting, modular functions, and that unmistakable Artem touch 💡

Labs are organized by language and topic, demonstrating key CS concepts through practical, well-commented code. This includes:

- **C labs**:  
  - Mastery of conditionals, loops, arrays, and pointers  
  - Switch-case logic, input/output operations, and dynamic memory  
  - Multidimensional matrix manipulations and structured function calls

- **C++ labs**:  
  - Function-based power series approximation  
  - Matrix transposition, dynamic allocation, and memory-safe addition  
  - String parsing, character analysis, and modular formatting

- **Rust labs**:  
  - Analytical function evaluation using Taylor series  
  - Fixed-size array slicing, iteration via `.iter()` and `.enumerate()`  
  - Algorithmic search and accumulation using safe, idiomatic patterns

Each lab is paired with a detailed Markdown assignment sheet under `/docs`, describing task goals, code structure, algorithms used, and sample outputs — so that reviewers, instructors, or future-you can follow the logic and admire the polish.

## ✍️ How to Use  

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/artem-sokol/academic-labs.git
   ```

2. Navigate to a lab folder  
   ```bash
   cd src_code/lab_6
   ```

3. Compile or run the script depending on language:  
   - C: `gcc task_2.c -o task_2 && ./task_2`  
   - C++: `g++ task_1.cpp -o task_1 && ./task_1`  
   - Rust: `cargo run` or `rustc task.rs && ./task`  
   - Python: `python task_3.py`

4. Open the corresponding lab description  
   ```
   docs/lab_6_assignment.md
   ```
